### Welcome to the Pacman Java open-source lesson plan! ###

The goal of this repository is to guide entry-level computer science students through creating a simple Pacman game using Java's Swing library and 2D graphics functionality. Students who have taken the equivalent of a collegiate introductory CS course or AP Computer Science will have the required experience level to create this project. A solid understanding of loops, functions, and basic class design is necessary.

The project is broken up into different parts, each with accompanying documentation, a specific goal, and learning points. Some sections also include some boilerplate code that can be copied. Each section has a dedicated wiki article that describes necessary changes and explains the concepts being taught. You can find the wiki article for part 1 [here](https://github.com/agulen/PacmanJava/wiki/Part-1), which involves rendering an image of Pacman to the screen.

**If you are a student:**

Head over to the part 1 wiki link to get started! You can follow along the wiki in your browser while you write code locally in your Java IDE. 


**If you are a course instructor:**

If you're looking to use this as teaching material to a class of students, the best way to do that would be to clone the git repository to your own device. Once you have the repository cloned, you can see the code changes required for each part of the project by examining the different git branches. For example, branch **part1_start** contains the expected start state of the repo and **part1_end** contains the end state of part 1. You can diff these branches to see what code the students will need to write! The wiki articles will still be useful resources for the students, so be sure to distribute them through a method of your choosing.

Good luck with the project! Have fun re-creating Pacman!
